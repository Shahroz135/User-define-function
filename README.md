          # User-define-function
In this program we will make a simple user 
define function for finding cube of any number 
which is given by user. There  are lots of things
which must be cleared before creating user define 
function like function declaration which occurs 
before the main function.  And function definition 
Or function header then actual and dummy parameters.
